# 🐶🐱 Dog vs Cat Image Classification (CNN)

## 📌 About the Project
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either **Dog** or **Cat**.  
The goal is to understand the complete workflow of an image classification task using deep learning.

## 🧠 What This Project Covers
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Building a CNN from scratch
- Training and validation of the model
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and loss

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
